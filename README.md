A demonstratation of what I have learned so far using Python

Coding alongside as I continue to read Automate the Boring Stuff with Python, I wanted to showcase my journey of learning Python as I continue to understand more about Python.

I also wanted to explore and learn about building and implementing my own functional video game using Python, therefore I started to watch Free Code Camps Youtube video series that goes over how to build simple games using Python.

I also recently built this small program that creates quiz files consisting of randomized questions and multiple choices, along with answer sheets to each randomized quiz .txt file.

I want to next build upon this program where instead of having the questions, multiple choices, answers, number of students, and number of questions predetermined, the program will allow the user to create their own customized quizzes tailored to their classrooms with their own inputs.
