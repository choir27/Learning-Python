A demonstratation of what I have learned so far using Python

Coding alongside as I continue to read Automate the Boring Stuff with Python, I wanted to showcase my journey of learning Python as I continue to understand more about Python.

I also wanted to explore and learn about building and implementing my own functional video game using Python, therefore I started to watch Free Code Camps Youtube video series that goes over how to build simple games using Python.

I also recently built this small program that creates quiz files consisting of randomized questions and multiple choices, along with answer sheets to each randomized quiz .txt file.  This small program accepts user input to create quizzes with customized number of questions, number of studentds, the contents of the question and the answers.

I want to add a "save" function for the user input, so that if the user wants to take a break and come back, save their progress, or edit their existing exams/answers, they have that option.
